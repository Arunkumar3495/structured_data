      "Enter the paragraph:  So another crushing win for South Africa at the Wankhede. The ball just seems to do a bit more under lights over here, and their bowlers exploited it beautifully once again as they did against England. Marco Jansen was superb again in his opening spell, troubling batters with pace, movement and extra bounce. Lizaad Williams, coming in for Ngidi, also found movement. They had Bangladesh at 31/3 inside 8 overs, and then Rabada and Coetzee took over the mantle of wicket-taking as they generally do. Even in the 15th over, the ball was nipping around, as evidenced by a beauty from Rabada to trap Litton Das LBW. Of course, the match was over by then. Bangladesh did have something to cheer about towards the end as Mahmudullah played beautifully to smash a hundred while the tail wagged in support. Still, they fell short by 149 runs - a reflection of the challenge they were facing after being hammered by de Kock and Klaasen earlier. South Africa smashed 143 in the last 10 overs against England, and 144 in the last 10 overs today. Bangladesh weren't coming back from that.\n",
